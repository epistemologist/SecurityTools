# Binary Visualization Tools

Various scripts that can be used to visualize raw binary data

## Inspirations
 - [This blog post](https://codisec.com/binary-visualization-explained/) was the main inspiration for the 2D and the 3D plotting scripts - in fact, many of the ideas in this and other blog posts from the developers of Veles were used here.


## Digrams
The script `gen_bigram_plot.py` generates a plot of the most common byte bigrams in the given data provided to stdin.

### Example Plots

#### ASCII Text
