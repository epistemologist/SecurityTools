# Security Tools
### Alternatively: How I Proved to Myself that I'm Not a Script Kiddie
##### Alteratively Alternatively: Remaking my Toolbox from Scratch

In my various excursions through learning about various things about security / CS in general, I often use a lot of tools that other people have developed. In the interest of completeness and just as a fun exercise, I thought that I would reimplement some of these tools for myself just to see how they work under the hood.
